## How to Connect Your Real Gemini Account (2 Minutes)

### Why No Login Button?

This app uses **cookie-based authentication** - it doesn't have a login form. Instead, it uses your existing Gemini browser session!

Think of it like this:
- You're already logged into Gemini in your browser
- We "borrow" your login cookies
- The app can now make requests as YOU

---

## Step-by-Step Setup:

### 1️⃣ Open Gemini in Your Browser

Go to: [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)

**Make sure you're logged in!** You should see the Gemini chat interface.

---

### 2️⃣ Extract Your Cookies

#### For Chrome/Edge:

1. Press **F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
2. Click the **Application** tab at the top
3. In the left sidebar: **Storage** → **Cookies** → `https://gemini.google.com`
4. Find these two cookies and **copy their Value**:

   **Cookie 1:** `__Secure-1PSID`
   - Click on it
   - Look at the **Value** column (very long string)
   - Double-click to select all
   - Press Ctrl+C to copy

   **Cookie 2:** `__Secure-1PSIDTS`
   - Do the same for this one

#### For Firefox:

1. Press **F12**
2. Click **Storage** tab
3. **Cookies** → `https://gemini.google.com`
4. Copy the same two cookies

---

### 3️⃣ Update Your `.env` File

1. Open the file: `d:\gemini web\.env`

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual cookies:

```env
# Gemini Cookie Authentication
GEMINI_COOKIE_1PSID=g.a000abc123...YOUR_ACTUAL_COOKIE_HERE
GEMINI_COOKIE_1PSIDTS=sidts-xyz789...YOUR_ACTUAL_COOKIE_HERE

# Optional: Set to 'development' or 'production'
FLASK_ENV=development
```

3. **Save the file**

---

### 4️⃣ Restart the Server

1. In your terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to stop the server
2. Run it again:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. You should see:
   ```
   🚀 Starting Gemini Web Integration Server...
   📍 Access the app at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

---

### 5️⃣ Verify Connection

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser
2. Look at the **top-right corner**
3. It should show: **"Connected"** with a **green dot** ✅

If it shows "Not Connected" with a red dot ❌:
- Your cookies might be wrong
- Try extracting them again
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE value (they're very long!)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Security:
- **Never share your `.env` file** - it contains your login cookies!
- Anyone with these cookies can access your Gemini account
- Use a secondary Google account if you're concerned

### Cookie Expiration:
- Cookies expire every **2-4 weeks**
- When they expire, just extract new ones and update `.env`
- You'll know they expired when the status shows "Not Connected"

---

## 🎯 What Happens After Setup?

Once your cookies are configured:

1. **Real Gemini Integration** - Images will be generated by actual Gemini AI
2. **Your Account Quota** - Uses your Gemini free/Pro account limits
3. **Same Quality** - Same image quality as the official Gemini website

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### "I can't find the cookies"
- Make sure you're logged into Gemini
- Try refreshing the Gemini page
- Use Chrome/Edge (easier to find cookies)

### "Status still shows 'Not Connected'"
- Check if you copied the ENTIRE cookie value
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the cookie names are exactly: `__Secure-1PSID` and `__Secure-1PSIDTS`

### "Where do I paste the cookies?"
- Open: `d:\gemini web\.env`
- Replace `your_secure_1psid_cookie_value_here` with your actual cookie
- Save the file
